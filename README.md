# Typing Simulator

The Typing Simulator is a Python-based application that automates typing tasks by simulating human-like keystrokes. It allows you to input text, set a hotkey, and specify the typing speed. When the hotkey is pressed, the program types the text at the desired speed in any active text field or application.
Features

  Customizable Hotkey: Set any hotkey combination to trigger the typing simulation.

  Adjustable Typing Speed: Choose from a range of speeds (10 to 200 words per minute).

  Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes for better visibility.

  Realistic Typing: Adds slight random delays between keystrokes to mimic human typing.

  User-Friendly GUI: Built with tkinter, featuring custom-designed buttons and text boxes.

## How to Use

  ### Run the Program:

  Execute the script to open the Typing Simulator window.

  ### Enter Text:

  In the "Enter text to type:" box, input the text you want the program to type.

  ### Set Hotkey:

  Specify the hotkey combination in the "Set hotkey:" field (e.g., ctrl+q).

  ### Select Typing Speed:

  Use the dropdown menu to choose the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

  ### Start Listening:

  Click the "Start Listening" button. The program will listen for the specified hotkey.

  ### Trigger Typing:

  Press the hotkey in any text field or application to start the typing simulation.

  ### Toggle Theme:

  Click the moon/sun icon in the top-right corner to switch between dark and light themes.

## Installation

### Install Python:

  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Download it from python.org.

### Install Required Libraries:

  Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

        pip install pyautogui keyboard

### Run the Program:

  Navigate to the directory containing the script and run:

        python typing_simulator.py

## Example Use Cases

### Automating Repetitive Typing:

  Use the program to type frequently used text, such as email templates or code snippets.

### Testing Applications:

  Simulate user input for testing text fields or forms in other applications.

### Demonstrations:

  Use the program to demonstrate typing in presentations or tutorials.

## Dependencies

    tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

    pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)

    keyboard (pip install keyboard)

## Limitations

  The program types text wherever the cursor is active. Ensure the correct text field or application is focused before triggering the hotkey.

  ### It does not support special formatting (e.g., bold, italics) or cursor movement (e.g., tabs, arrow keys).
